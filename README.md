# nnfs-go

**nnfs-go** is a collection of neural network implementations and tensor operations from scratch in Go. This repository is inspired by the [Neural Networks from Scratch book](https://nnfs.io/) and other resources, aiming to provide practical examples and educational materials for building neural networks and performing tensor operations using Go.

**Note:** This project is still a work in progress. It's barely started, to be honest. I'm working on it in my free time, and I'm not sure how far I'll go with this project. I'm doing it for fun and to learn more about neural networks and Go.
